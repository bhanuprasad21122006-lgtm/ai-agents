# AAA Game Studio Multi-Agent Orchestrator

An AI-powered **14-agent collaborative development pipeline** that simulates a full AAA game studio workflow using **Google ADK**, **Gemini 3.1 Flash**, and **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

This system demonstrates how specialized agents can replace traditional studio roles and coordinate end-to-end game production planning automatically.

# Problem Statement

AAA game development requires large multidisciplinary teams:

* Designers
* Programmers
* AI engineers
* Artists
* Network engineers
* Testers
* Performance specialists
* Live operations teams

Early-stage prototyping is slow, expensive, and coordination-heavy.

This project solves that by orchestrating **autonomous role-specific agents** into a structured production pipeline.

---

# Solution

We built a **multi-agent orchestration engine** that simulates a professional studio workflow across **9 production phases** using 14 specialized AI agents.

Each agent:

* owns a production responsibility
* produces structured artifacts
* validates upstream outputs
* hands off results downstream

The result is a complete AI-driven game production lifecycle planner.

# 2-Minute Demo Pitch Script — AAA Game Studio Multi-Agent Orchestrator

Hello everyone,

Game development at the AAA level normally requires large multidisciplinary teams — designers, programmers, AI engineers, artists, testers, network specialists, and live-operations staff. Coordinating these roles takes months before a playable prototype even exists.

So we asked a simple question:

What if a studio pipeline itself could be automated using AI agents?

To solve this, we built the **AAA Game Studio Multi-Agent Orchestrator** — a system that simulates a professional game studio using **14 specialized AI agents** powered by **Gemini 3.1 Flash** and coordinated through **Google ADK**.

Instead of a single assistant generating ideas, our system assigns structured responsibilities across nine production phases:

Design
Gameplay logic
AI behavior
Graphics and UI
Networking
Asset coordination
Testing
Optimization
Live deployment planning

Each agent produces artifacts and passes them forward through validation checkpoints, exactly like a real production pipeline.

For example, when we input:

“Build a tactical multiplayer extraction shooter”

our agents automatically generate:

a gameplay architecture
NPC behavior logic
level structure planning
graphics pipeline strategy
network synchronization models
testing frameworks
performance optimization plans
and a live-operations roadmap

All executed locally as a coordinated orchestration workflow.

Technically, this project demonstrates:

multi-agent collaboration
phase-aware execution pipelines
artifact-based validation loops
Model Context Protocol tool integration
and studio-grade workflow simulation

This transforms early-stage game planning from a manual multi-week effort into an automated multi-minute pipeline.

Our long-term vision is simple:

AI won’t just assist developers — it will simulate entire production teams.

Thank you.
